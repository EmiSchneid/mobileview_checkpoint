        <h1>New to photography?</h1>
    </header>
    <main id='main'>
        <p>Start with what you have! Thanks to smartphones with increasing camera quality, millions of us have access to a more 
            than capable camera. Years ago, I got seriously into photography with an old iPhone and a determination 
            to capture the magic of my beloved dog at the beach. Since my dog passed at nearly 17 years old in 2021, some of those photos 
            I took of him on my first iPhone remain my favorites of the thousands I took of him. </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://petapixel.com/photography-quotes/">“The camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera.”
            — Dorothea Lange</blockquote>
        <p>The most important thing I learned shooting on an iPhone was how to compose shots and that sometimes the best shot requires us to squat or kneel on the ground 
            (hello, dog photography!). The quality of your natural lighting and your angle to the light source is the secret ingredient 
            to fabulous shots you'll keep forever. All the following photos were taken on an iPhone:</p>
        <div class="grid-container">
            <div><img class="image-animation" src="images/willow_flats_iphone.jpg" alt="Green vegetation in foreground, water and Teton mountain range in backgroun."></div>
            <div><img src="images/longs_portrait_iphone.JPG" alt="Winter scene in Rocky Mountain National Park with pine trees in foreground, 
            snowy mountains in background, and bright blue sky with puffy white clouds."></div>

            <div><img src="images/mama_tetons_iphone.jpg" alt="Woman sitting on fence, looking at mountains."></div>
            <div><img src="images/skye_running_iphone.jpg" alt="White dog running along water's edge after a toy with waves crashing in the background
            and footprints in the sand in the foreground."></div>

            <div><img src="images/skye_dripping_iphone.jpg" alt="White and black dog staring at camera, smiling, dripping with water."></div>
            <div><img src="images/skye_beach_shadow_iphone.jpg" alt="White dog on beach." ></div>
            <div><img src="images/skye_stairs_iphone.jpg" alt="White and black dog smiling, lying on blue-purple stair landing with front legs overhanging 
            the endge of the landing."></div>

        <p>No matter what camera you use, understanding some principles of photography can give you more shots you're happy with, 
            and hopefully some you're thrilled with! A good place to start is knowing terms like exposure, composition, and resolution, which 
            are impacted by aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and lens length or zoom. Check out the technical explanations below for 
            a beginner-friendly rundown of these terms to get you started.</p>
